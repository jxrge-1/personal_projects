#Banking101

The Banking101 file creates a class constructor for the Account class and loads the user\'92s name and banking ID. 
The program is a small version of a banking system where the user can deposit money, withdraw money, get the last transaction done
whether it was to deposit or withdraw, and can tell how much money 
will be accured on interest based on how much money is present in the bank with a fixed percentage of 1.85%
